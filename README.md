## Government gets its own ChatGPT

I thought this was interesting since this brings to question to the level of influence ChatGPT will have on government policies.
I also saw how they planned on using (like drafting memos and creating weekly plans). This brings to question on what decisions in the near future might be based on influence from ChatGPT. 

Also, the article mentioned that OpenAI acknowledged that over 90,000 employees were already using ChatGPT. Roughly 18 million prompts were generated since 2024. Could this mean that OpenAI will have more or less influence than it already does in the public sector? I'm not entirely sure how this will affect me or if it at all will, but it's kind of cool to see how quickly AI has become a necessity in all areas.
