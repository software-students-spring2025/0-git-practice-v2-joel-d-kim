## Government gets its own ChatGPT

I thought this was interesting since this brings to question to the level of influence ChatGPT will have on government policies.
I also saw how they planned on using (like drafting memos and creating weekly plans). This brings to question on what decisions in the near future might be based on influence from ChatGPT. 

Also, the article mentioned that OpenAI acknowledged that over 90,000 employees were already using ChatGPT. Roughly 18 million prompts were generated since 2024. Could this mean that OpenAI will have more or less influence than it already does in the public sector? I'm not entirely sure how this will affect me or if it at all will, but it's kind of cool to see how quickly AI has become a necessity in all areas.

**Tim Xu - I feel two primary concerns about the poential widespread usage of ChatGPT in government offices. First, despite saying that they will retain "existing security and privacy measures", I wonder if this still poses a security threat, depending on what their security measures are. Also, I wonder if the usage of ChatGPT in govermnent offices undermines the hard work of those who are not using ChatGPT, or poses any threat to those who are affected by those governing offices.**
